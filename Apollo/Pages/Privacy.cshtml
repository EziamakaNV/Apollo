<p>
    At Apollo, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
</p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>
    We collect personal health information that you provide to us through our platform, including but not limited to symptoms, medical history, health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, temperature), and any images you upload. This data is used to provide you with personalized medical information and connect you with healthcare professionals for second opinions.
</p>

<h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
<p>
    Your data is securely stored on our servers, which are hosted in facilities that comply with the highest industry standards for data security. All personal health information is encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.
</p>

<p>
    We employ administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Access to your personal health information is restricted to authorized personnel who require it to perform their job functions and provide you with our services.
</p>

<h3>HIPAA Compliance</h3>
<p>
    As a healthcare-related platform, we adhere to the regulations set forth by HIPAA. We implement the necessary safeguards to ensure that your personal health information is kept confidential and secure, in accordance with HIPAA's Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule.
</p>

<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>
    All data collected through our platform is encrypted at rest using advanced encryption standards (AES). This ensures that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, your personal health information remains protected and unreadable without the proper decryption keys.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, all data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to protect your information during transmission.
</p>

<h3>Access and Control</h3>
<p>
    You have the right to access, update, and delete your personal health information at any time. You can manage your data through your account settings or by contacting our support team. We will respond to your requests in a timely manner and in compliance with HIPAA requirements.
</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>
    We retain your personal health information for as long as necessary to provide you with our services and as required by law. When your data is no longer needed, we ensure that it is securely deleted or anonymized in accordance with industry best practices.
</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your personal health information.
